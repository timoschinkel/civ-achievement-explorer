# Contribution guidelines

Hi! Thank you for contributing to this project. Before you create a pull request please read the following guidelines:

Changes to the achievement specifications are welcome, but try to back up your changes with argumentations and if possible source material.

Any other changes should be preceeded by opening an [issue](https://github.com/timoschinkel/civ-achievement-explorer/issues/new/choose).

Please keep in mind that this is **my** experiment. I have made this project publicly available for other people to use, and to learn. That means that **I** am the person that will have the final say about accepting contributions.

Please stay civil.
